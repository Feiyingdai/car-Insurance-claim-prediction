# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction with XGBoost

This project develops an XGBoost-based predictive model to identify high-risk drivers who are likely to file car insurance claims. The model leverages domain-specific features from driver demographics, vehicle details, regional conditions, and driving behavior.

### 🌟 Project Overview

#### Objective:

Predict whether a driver will make a claim (binary classification), enabling data-driven risk stratification and personalized insurance management.

#### Business Applications:

💰 Risk-based Premium Adjustment
Adjust insurance pricing based on predicted claim probabilities

🛡️ Tailored Underwriting Rules
Define acceptance thresholds or policy conditions based on risk profiles

🚘 Proactive Behavioral Interventions
Identify high-risk drivers early and offer training, incentives, or personalized feedback to reduce claim likelihood

### 📊 Dataset Overview

Training set: 590,000+ rows

Test set: 890,000+ rows

Target variable: target (1 = made a claim, 0 = no claim)

---

### 🚀 Quick Start

To get started quickly, follow these steps:


#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Feiyingdai/Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction.git
cd Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
```


#### 2. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost optuna shap matplotlib seaborn
```

#### 3. Run the notebook

Open the notebook using Jupyter or Colab:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/car_insurance_claim_prediction.ipynb
```


#### 4. Use the sample dataset

A small sample dataset `sample_data.csv` (100 rows) is included in the `data/` folder for testing and quick experimentation.

```python
# Load sample data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')
df.head()
```

**3. 📌 Business Interpretation**

By stratifying drivers based on optimal threshold (KS=0.64), we can segment the population into low-risk and high-risk groups, enabling targeted actions across pricing, underwriting, and behavioral strategies:

**🔎 Risk-Based Premium Adjustment**

- **High-risk drivers**  
  - Apply surcharges  
  - Remove discounts such as loss-free bonus  

- **Low-risk drivers**  
  - Offer loyalty-based incentives (e.g., premium rebates or safe-driving discounts)

**🧾 Tailored Underwriting Rules**

- **High-risk drivers**  
  - Set higher deductibles  
  - Cap maximum coverage limits  
  - Require telematics device installation for behavior monitoring

- **Low-risk drivers**  
  - Enable instant policy approval  
  - Minimize documentation requirements

**🚦 Proactive Behavioral Interventions**

- **High-risk drivers**  
  - Recommend incentivized defensive driving courses  
  - Provide monthly updated risk score summaries  
  - Send personalized safe-driving reminders via email or app notifications

These measures not only improve portfolio profitability but also contribute to long-term risk reduction by encouraging safer driving behavior.
