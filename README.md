## üåü Project Overview

### Backgorund:

In recent years, Tesla's intelligent systems and high performance have gained significant market traction. However, some models such as **Model Y and Cybertruck exhibit elevated claim frequencies and costs**, attracting attention from insurers and regulators. These trends are driven by:
- High repair costs associated with intelligent systems
- Complex Autopilot-related accident factors
- Heterogeneous driver behaviors and vehicle usage scenarios

**This poses increased underwriting and payout risks for insurers**. The project proposes building a **machine learning-based dynamic risk prediction model** to modernize the traditional actuarial approach, leveraging data-driven modeling to quantify risk more accurately.

### Objective:

1. Identify high-risk vehicle models, driving behavior patterns and predict the likelihood of claims over a defined period.
2. Provide quantitative basis for dynamic pricing and risk stratification.

### Business Applications:

üí∞ Risk-based Premium Adjustment
Adjust insurance pricing based on predicted claim probabilities

üõ°Ô∏è Tailored Underwriting Rules
Define acceptance thresholds or policy conditions based on risk profiles

üöò Proactive Behavioral Interventions
Identify high-risk drivers early and offer training, incentives, or personalized feedback to reduce claim likelihood

## üßπ Data Cleaning

The raw dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to improve quality and ensure modeling readiness. Key steps are outlined below:

### üßº Missing Value Handling

- **Categorical Variables:**
  - For some high-impact features (e.g., `ps_car_07_cat`,`ps_ind_05_cat`), missing values were **not imputed with mode**.
  <img width="1180" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47e3eeef-299c-4ff9-b1ba-2bf5f56d7dc4" />
  
  - Instead, they were **assigned a value of `-1`** and treated as a **separate category**, as EDA showed:
    - Missing values had **non-random patterns**
    - Their presence was predictive of **higher/lower claim risk**
   
  - For non high-impact features, missing values were **imputed with mode**.

- **Numerical Variables:**
  - Median imputation was applied to continuous variables like `ps_reg_03` (EV charger density/km¬≤), which had skewed distributions.
  <img width="728" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632bdf76-4214-4c6b-8f74-db38b88b26ca" />


### üîç Outlier Detection & Clipping

- Used the **IQR method** to clip extreme values in:
  - `ps_car_12` (charging time per session)
  - `ps_car_15` (Autopilot usage frequency)
- This avoided distortion of downstream feature scaling and model training.


### ‚öñÔ∏è Initial Class Imbalance Check

- The target variable (`claim_filed`) was highly imbalanced (~3% positive class).
  <img width="597" height="422" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de83ae86-fb36-4386-bb05-30c5f9810ea7" />

- Multiple strategies were later evaluated:
  - **`scale_pos_weight`**
  - **Borderline-SMOTE**
  - **Iterative undersampling(best performer)**

---
## üìå Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed a thorough exploratory analysis to better understand data distribution, and explore relationships between key features and the target variable.

**Key EDA Highlights:**
To understand feature-target relationships and identify predictive patterns, we visualized:

- **Continuous features** using boxplots, grouped by target (claim filed vs not)
- **Categorical features** using aggregated claim rates per category level, by calculating **claim rate by category**, we avoided repeating the 0/1 bars and enhanced interpretability for categorical features.

### üîç Key Observations:
1. An **unexpected pattern** was observed with `ps_ind_01` (Driver Age), `ps_ind_03` (Driving Experience): claimants appear to have **higher driver age and driving experience values** on average.
This may suggest:
- Experience is not linearly related to safe driving
- More experienced drivers may take more risks or drive longer distances

2. Also **contrary to expectations**, `ps_car_15` (Autopilot usage) shows **slightly higher values among claimants**.
This observation suggests:
- Heavier reliance on Autopilot may **not reduce claim risk**, and might even be associated with riskier driving contexts
- Possible explanations include:
  - Overconfidence when using semi-autonomous systems
  - More highway driving exposure (where Autopilot is typically used)

3. Tesla Dashcam installationÔºà`ps_ind_07_bin = 1`Ôºâshows **a higher claim rate** among users who have installed the device.
This suggests:
- Dashcam-equipped drivers are more likely to file a claim
- Possible explanations include:
  - Drivers with dashcams may be more assertive in reporting incidents, knowing they have video evidence
  - Dashcam installation could be more common among risk-conscious or previously involved drivers
  - Alternatively, it might reflect reverse causality: drivers with prior incidents tend to install dashcams afterward

4.Interestingly, `ps_ind_06_bin` (accident history) shows **lower claim rates** for users with prior accident records.
This may reflect:
- **Behavioral correction**: Drivers with prior incidents may drive more cautiously afterward
- **Claims aversion**: Experienced claimants might avoid filing for minor damages due to higher premiums or claim fatigue
- **Policy design effects**: Insurers may impose stricter rules (e.g., higher deductibles) on drivers with prior accidents, reducing future claims

5. High-risk occupations (`ps_ind_04_cat = 1`) show significantly higher claim rates
   
6. High traffic congestion(`ps_reg_02`) show higher claim rates

<img width="1195" height="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15e631b9-3a05-450e-be4b-f460fbd22e46" />

<img width="1187" height="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/693f86e6-875d-4bcf-a2b5-1a1a2c885298" />

### üîç Several counter-intuitive insights emerged during EDAÔºö
- Highlight the **limitations of linear modeling**, where such non-monotonic or interaction-driven effects are difficult to capture.
- As a result, we chose to build a **tree-based model (XGBoost)** to automatically learn complex **non-linear relationships** and **feature interactions**, rather than assuming a linear form.

---


## üß© Feature Engineering & Selection

Feature engineering focused on encoding, interaction, and dimensionality reduction.

### üß© Encoding Strategy

- **XGBoost Native Categorical Handling (`enable_categorical=True`)**: Applied to low-cardinality categorical variables
- **Target Encoding**: Used for high-cardinality features `ps_car_11_cat`(battery health score)
   - To **prevent data leakage and avoid overfitting**, we used:
    - **10-fold cross-validation**: computed encodings from out-of-fold data
    - **Smoothing**: blended category mean with global mean based on frequency to avoid overfitting for rare categories

### üìä Correlation Heatmap
As part of exploratory analysis, we plotted a correlation heatmap to detect highly linear relationships between features.

While this provides useful insights into data structure (e.g., identifying pairs like `ps_reg_03` and `ps_reg_02` with corr > 0.7), we did **not rely on it for feature elimination**.
<img width="982" height="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cecbedc-ad47-46b5-bd0a-c88191c0f472" />

- Correlation matrices‚Äîespecially Pearson or even Spearman‚Äîare limited to capturing linear or monotonic patterns. They may miss nonlinear redundancy or overstate the relationship between unrelated variables.  
- Therefore, final feature selection was based on **model-based importance** rather than correlation alone.



### üß¨ Interaction Features

- Engineered combinations for numerical features like:
  - `Autopilot usage √ó region congestion`
  - `Autopilot usage √ó driving age`

### ü™ì Feature Selection Process
-  **Variance Filtering**
  - Removed features with **near-zero variance**
  - These features contribute little to model differentiation and often introduce noise

- Used a **shallow XGBoost model with strong regularization** (high Œª, Œ≥) to evaluate feature importance.

  **Selection Criteria:**
  - `Gain > median(gain)`
  - `Weight > median(weight)`
  - Final model retained **122 features** based on intersection of both


## üß† Model Building
We trained an XGBoost model to predict claim probability using individual, vehicle, regional, and behavioral features. Key steps include:

### Class Imbalance Handling
The dataset was highly imbalanced, with only ~3% positive class. We experimented with:
- scale_pos_weight (XGBoost internal re-weighting)
- Borderline-SMOTE (oversampling near decision boundaries)
- ‚úÖIterative Undersampling (best result)
  
### Iterative Undersampling Strategy:
**Steps:***
- Train multiple models on different undersampled subsets, for each base model:
  - Use all positive samples
  - Randomly sample a 1:1 ratio of negative samples
- Repeat this process iteratively until all negative samples are used across the ensemble
- Train a separate model on each subset
- Final predictions are averaged across all models

**Benefits:**
- Preserves full signal from minority class, without introducing synthetic examples- ensuring the real data distribution is maintained
- Provides balanced training sets to reduce model bias
- Helps prevent overfitting and increases model robustness via ensemble diversity

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used Optuna for 10-fold cross-validation to tune max_depth, n_estimators, learning_rate, etc.
- Regularization (lambda, gamma) applied to prevent overfitting
  
---

## üìä Model Evaluation

### üîç Model Performance
The final XGBoost model was trained on iteratively undersampled data (1:1 positive-to-negative sampling, rotating through the entire negative class) to preserve the full signal of positive (claim) cases without introducing synthetic noise.
- Validation AUC: ~0.64 (holdout set)
  
  <img width="575" height="439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/179eee2a-1067-4e04-b5cd-28ae18d5dc6e" />
- Test AUC: ~0.69
  
  <img width="590" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d8c2d7e-5015-49af-9d04-42362b0d377b" />
  
This indicates a reasonably strong ability to rank drivers by claim risk, despite severe class imbalance in the raw data.

### üéØ Threshold-Based Risk Segmentation
To convert predicted probabilities into actionable business segments, thresholds were tuned using the holdout set to:
- Ensure high recall for claimants (minimize missed high-risk individuals)
- Maintain a realistic distribution across Low / Medium / High risk groups

**Precision & Recall vs Threshold on holdout set**

<img width="580" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe3864f7-3f34-475c-8e75-c6395ffe7029" />

By balancing the recall vs. operational cost tradeoff, we set:
**High-Risk Threshold (0.54)**
**Low-Risk Threshold (0.37)**


| Metric                      | Holdout Set                  | Testing Set                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| AUC                         | 0.64                         | 0.69                       |
| High-Risk Threshold (‚â•0.54) | 27% of users, Recall = 46.5% | 24% of users, Recall = 53% |
| Low-Risk Threshold (<0.37)  | 20% of users, Recall = 90%   | 20% of users, Recall = 94% |

In testing dataset, **94% of all claimants were captured in the Medium and High risk groups**, suggesting that the Low-Risk group is truly low-risk and well suited for business strategies like faster approval or preferential pricing.

### ‚úÖ Key Insights
- Iterative undersampling allowed efficient use of all negative samples while fully retaining rare positive cases.
- The model supports actionable segmentation, enabling risk-based policy adjustments.
- Thresholding strategy is business-aligned: it balances customer volume with risk sensitivity.

## üîç SHAP Feature Importance

To better understand the final XGBoost model's decision-making process, we computed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values on the holdout dataset.

### üîß Why SHAP?

Traditional feature importance metrics like **Gain** or **Weight** are biased in the presence of multicollinearity ‚Äî where only the first selected variable captures the importance.  
SHAP overcomes this by **fairly distributing contributions** across correlated features and explaining the **marginal contribution** of each feature to the prediction.

### üìà SHAP Summary Plot
Note: Due to privacy constraints, full feature names have been masked or abbreviated.

Most important features are shown below, ranked by average absolute SHAP value:

<img width="846" height="877" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5872d384-d60d-4bc7-b07c-09731237d0cc" />

- ps_ind_05_cat and `ps_car_01_cat` (car attributes) are among the most predictive.
- A composite encoded feature combining `ps_car_11_cat`(battery health) and `ps_car_13` shows significant importance, highlighting the benefit of targeted feature engineering.
- ps_ind_17_bin (binary behavioral feature) and ps_ind_07_bin (Tesla Dashcam usage) also contributed substantially to the model‚Äôs prediction. Model shows Dashcam-equipped drivers are more likely to file a claim, supporting the finding from EDA.

---  

## üíº Business Interpretation
Based on the predicted claim probabilities and segmented risk thresholds, we identified three distinct customer groups:
- High Risk (‚â• 0.54): ~27% of customers; recall = 46.5% (Holdout), 53% (Testing)
- Low Risk (< 0.37): ~20% of customers; recall = 90% (Holdout), 94% (Testing)
- Medium Risk (in-between): Remaining ~53%
  
By tailoring insurance strategies to these segments, the company can optimize underwriting decisions, balance portfolio risk, and improve operational efficiency.

### üü• High-Risk Customers
These customers are significantly more likely to file a claim. To mitigate financial risk, insurers can:
**Goal**:Reduce future claim exposure by proactively managing the riskiest segment.
**Action**Ôºö
- Cap maximum coverage limits: Prevent large losses by limiting payout ceilings.
- Set higher deductibles: Shift small-claim risk to customers and discourage frequent minor claims.
- Restrict optional coverages: Limit access to high-cost add-ons such as rental car reimbursement, windshield coverage, etc.
- Apply stricter underwriting rules: Consider conditional acceptance, higher premiums, or require additional documentation.

### üü® Medium-Risk Customers
This group represents a large portion of the portfolio with moderate claim probability. Strategies should focus on risk management and behavior improvement:
**Goal**: Shift medium-risk customers to a lower risk group through targeted interventions.
**Action**Ôºö
- Usage-based insurance (UBI): Dynamically price premiums based on real-time driving behavior.
- Incentivized safety programs: Offer discounts for completing safety training or defensive driving courses.
- Customized engagement: Monitor over time and adjust pricing or policies as behaviors change.

### üü© Low-Risk Customers
Customers predicted to have very low claim probability. 
**Goal**: Retain valuable customers and offer rewards.
**Action**:
- Offer loyalty incentives: Discounts, extended coverage, or rewards for claim-free history.
- Bundle products: Cross-sell life, home, or umbrella insurance to improve customer lifetime value.
- Fast-track underwriting: Simplify approval and offer streamlined digital experiences.
